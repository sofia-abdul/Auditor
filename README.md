# Fire Safety technology

A fire safety monitoring prototype designed on a remote-controlled car using thermal and radar sensors with a dashboard for visualising live data.

## About

This project explores fire and heat monitoring by combining thermal sensing with radar-based motion detection. The system is deployed on a remote-controlled vehicle, allowing sensor data to be collected while the car is manually driven through an environment.

## Features

* Thermal temperature sensing
* Radar-based motion or presence detection
* Manual RC movement using a handheld remote
* Live sensor data displayed on a dashboard

## Future Ideas

* Semi-autonomous navigation
* IoT dashboard integration
* Machine learning based fire risk classification
* etc
