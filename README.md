# Fire Safety technology

A fire safety monitoring prototype designed for use on  remote-controlled car using thermal and radar sensors with a dashboard for visualising live data.

## About

This project explores basic fire and heat monitoring by combining thermal sensing with radar-based motion detection. The system allows sensor data to be collected while moving through an environment rather than from a fixed position.

## What It Does

* Measures temperature using a thermal sensor
* Detects motion or presence with a radar sensor
* Displays live sensor readings on a dashboard

## Why Thermal and Radar Sensors

* Traditional fire detection systems often rely heavily on smoke sensors, which can be slow to respond and prone to false alarms
* Thermal sensors allow early identification of heat sources before flames or smoke fully develop
* Radar sensors can detect movement or presence
* Combining both sensors provides more information during testing and can reduce unnecessary alerts

## Future Ideas

* Semi-autonomous navigation
* Integration with IoT dashboards
* Machine learning based fire risk classification
* etc
